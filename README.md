## ✨ Features

- **Smooth Controls**: Intuitive arrow key navigation
- **Real-time Scoring**: Live score display that updates with each food eaten
- **Collision Detection**: Game ends when hitting walls or your own tail
- **Dynamic Food Spawning**: Food appears randomly across the game area
- **Clean Graphics**: Black background with colorful snake and food elements
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular code structure for easy maintenance

## 🎮 Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Control the snake to eat as much food as possible
2. **Movement**: Use arrow keys to change direction
3. **Growth**: Snake grows longer with each food eaten
4. **Scoring**: Score increases by 1 for each food consumed
5. **Game Over**: Occurs when snake hits walls or its own tail
6. **Restart**: Click anywhere to close the game window

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No additional packages required (uses built-in Turtle library)
