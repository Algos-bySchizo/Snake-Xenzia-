# Snake Xenzia - Requirements
# This project uses only Python built-in libraries

# Python version requirement
# The game requires Python 3.7 or higher for optimal performance
# All other dependencies (turtle, random, time) are built-in Python modules

# No external packages required
# Built-in modules used:
# - turtle (for graphics)
# - random (for food positioning)
# - time (for game loop timing)
